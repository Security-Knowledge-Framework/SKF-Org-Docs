- ## Preface
  Our experience taught us that the current level of security of web applications is not sufficient enough to ensure security. This is mainly because web developers simply aren't aware of the risks and dangers that are lurking, and waiting to be exploited by hackers. Because of this, we decided to develop a framework to create a guide system available for all developers so they can develop applications secure by design from the start.
